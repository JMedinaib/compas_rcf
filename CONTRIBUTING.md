# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and very much appreciated!

## Code contributions

We accept code contributions through pull requests.
In short, this is how that works.

**Important:** All code related to fabrication with ABB industrial robots requires [compas_rrc](https://bitbucket.com/eth-rfl/compas_rrc) which is hosted in a private repository.

1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/compas_rcf) and clone the fork.

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment using your tool of choice (e.g. `virtualenv`, `conda`, etc).

    * Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

    ```bash
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    # use conda to install compas_fab if possible
    conda create -n compas_rcf-dev python=3.7 git compas_fab
    conda activate compas_rcf-dev
    ```

    * Using [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv)

    ```bash
    virtualenv --python=python3.7 {{path/to/venv}}
    source {{path/to/venv}}/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install development dependencies:

   ```bash
   # install compas_rrc separately
   pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/ethrfl/compas_rrc#egg=compas_rrc-v0.2.2
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

   If you have authentication issues with BitBucket (for compas_rrc) [Try installing
   the new Git Credential manager for Windows](https://compas_rcf.tetov.se/known_issues.html#authentication-problems-with-bitbucket-1)

4. (Optional) Make package accessible in Rhino and Grasshopper

   ```bash
   python -m compas_rcf.install_rhino
   ```

5. Make sure all tests pass:

   ```bash
   invoke test
   ```

6. Start making your changes to the **master** branch (or branch off of it).
7. Make sure all tests still pass:

   ```bash
   invoke test
   ```

8. Add yourself to the *Contributors* section of `AUTHORS.md`.
9. Document the changes in the `CHANGELOG.md`
10. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub.
11. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) through the GitHub website.

During development, use [pyinvoke](http://docs.pyinvoke.org/) tasks on the
command line to ease recurring operations:

* `invoke clean`: Clean all generated artifacts.
* `invoke check`: Run various code and documentation style checks.
* `invoke docs`: Generate documentation.
* `invoke test`: Run all tests and checks in one swift command.
* `invoke`: Show available tasks.
